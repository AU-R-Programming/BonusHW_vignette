The `irg` package is based on the procedure proposed in @heerah2021granger.

```{r}
library(irg)
```

The functions made available allow to perform Granger-Causal testing for signals that are sampled at the same but irregularly spaced time points. Before using the functions in the package, the signals need to be pre-processed such that they are detrended (mean-stationary) and standardized (normalized). Below we show some examples of possible ways of pre-processing the signals as well as how to use the main functions of the package.
